You are number one on
[HackerNews](https://hn.algolia.com/?q=tree+calculus)! This message
arrived as I was getting ready for bed but of course I had to follow the action. 
The comments were streaming through. Some friends were clarifying,
referencing etc. I didn't say much. Views of [my website]
(Github.com/barry-jay-personal) went from zero to three thousand
overnight! And this for a book that went online four years ago!
Perhaps the ice has finally broken!

Well, steady on, Barry. Views are back down to a couple of hundred;
you are already yesterday's news.  However that plays out, I'd like to
respond to all those comments here. Presumably, those readers that already
care will find it but you can repost to HackerNews or elsewhere if you
think it appropriate.

I noticed four kinds of reaction.
  - Wow, cool! 
  - I can't parse this: how does the BNF of the terms relate to those unlabelled trees? 
  - There's nothing new here: it is a glorified
  $\lambda$-calculus/combinatory logic/S-expressions/syntax trees/Lisp.
   - This is so wrong! Is he a crackpot?

Cool kids, I'll write a separate post, just for you. Here I want to address the criticisms.

### Syntax versus Semantics

The BNF says that every term, every combination is either a leaf
$\Delta$ or an application $MN$ of combinations. The semantics of
$\Delta$ is a tree that is a mere leaf.  The semantics of $MN$
combines the tree $T_1$ for $M$ with the tree $T_2$ for $N$ by
attaching $T_2$ as the right-most branch of the root of $T_1$ to get a
tree $T$. For example, if $T_1$ is a binary tree then $T$ is a ternary
tree. There are lots of examples in the
[book](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/tree-calculus/tree_book.pdf).

### Trivial or Wrong?

Until now, tree calculus has never survived peer-review. Of three
reviews, one would think it cute, one think it trivial and one think
it wrong. Of course, it can't be trivially true and also wrong, so
what is going on? Well, it would be wrong if Church's Thesis were true
in any interesting way. Although it makes sense for numbers, Church's Thesis is
false for general computation. I've written about this with Jose
Vergara in the appendix of my book, and [blogged about
it](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/blog/blob/main/2024-12-09-poetry-to-prose.md)
the other day. This is why some people think I'm a crackpot. But a theorem trumps a thesis. Nuff said for now.

The final question is whether it adds expressive power compared to the
systems mentions above.  The short answer is yes, since, for example,
tree calculus can decide equality of programs while these other
systems cannot. In my experience, people accept this point about
$\lambda$-calculus and combinatory logic but struggle with syntax trees and Lisp.

### Syntax Trees
Since unlabelled trees carry less information than
syntax trees, haven't we given up some expressive power? Where's the payoff?

There are several payoffs. First, syntax trees are artificial. They
can be used to model a particular programming language but not
computation in general. By contrast, the unlabelled trees are natural,
like the numbers, and general enough to model any language. Syntax
trees are to special purpose Turing machines as natural trees are to a
universal Turing machine.

Second, where evaluation rules are applied to syntax trees, full
expressive power requires that the rules be [intensional](
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397519301227)
in that the internal structure of arguments is sometimes examined but
usually the rules are *extensional* just like those of
$\lambda$-calculus and combinatory logic. Has anyone considered how to
add intensionality to something more practical than combinatory logic?

### Lisp

For this discussion, the key point about Lisp is the existence of
quote and eval: quote embeds raw syntax into the calculus, delaying
its conversion to an executable by eval until the environment has been
determined. If the executables are thought of as Turing machines, then quotation
imports the tape of some other machine. Of course, equality of tapes
is a triviality but equality of machines makes no sense. This is still
true after enriching by quotation. From the viewpoint of tree calculus, quote was a first step
towards intensional programming.

# My Word for 2025
## Barry Jay
### 2024-12-22

It's time to choose my word of the year. Something to focus on when I
hesitate, to remind me about my goals.  A word is better than a
resolution. Not only is it shorter, but it's more robust. You make a
resolution in January, break it in February and now you're busted for
the year. You have let down your resolution.  What a failure! But a
watchword is an aspiration, a friendly reminder, there when you need it,
without ever failing.

In 2021, my watchword was

## Share

I had finished writing the book in
2020, but my publisher was unable to find an expert willing to write a
review, and didn't know what to do. So I pulled out and
self-published. But who would know it existed? So sharing it was. For
example, I summarised each chapter in a
[tweet](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/tree-calculus/blob/master/tweets_on_trees.pdf). I
don't remember my watchwords for 2022 and 2023.



In 2024, my watchword was

## Finish

Ever since the book went online, I
have been working on type systems for tree calculus, with the goal of typing a self-interpreter.
I accumulated
partial results by developing tree types, making them subtypes of
function types, and typing generic queries.  In mid 2023, I showed how to
type a self-interpreter, but only in the presence of a Top type, which
seemed like cheating.  I fully expected to eliminate it by the end of
that year but was still stuck. So my focus for 2024 was to finish
something. If necessary, write up the ugly solution with Top
types. Happily, this was avoided by introducing the *as-function*
types, which activate when their argument becomes a function type. The
same day as the verfication in Coq was completed, I saw the call for
papers for [PEPM](https://popl25.sigplan.org/home/pepm-2025), wrote
the [paper](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/typed_tree_calculus/blob/main/typed_program_analysis.pdf)
in ten days for presentation in January. Finished!

This word helped keep me motivated through the year, but its true
value would have emerged if the better proof had not emerged. It would
have urged me to confront the issue, and made it easier to pursue the
weaker result.

Now it's time to choose a word for 2025. I still have a lifetime of
research goals (implementation of heaps as trees, generic algebraic
data types, complexity theory, foundations of mathematics, etc) but
need to pace myself a little. Working for three years without anything
to show for it was a little stressful. I kept reminding myself that
there is no Plan B. That done, I plan to keep working, but also need
to recharge the batteries. So my watchword for 2025 is

## Fun

What will your watchword be?

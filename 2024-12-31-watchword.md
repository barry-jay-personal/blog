# My Word for 2025
## Barry Jay
### 2024-12-22

It's time to choose my word of the year, my watchword. Something to focus on when I
hesitate, to remind me about my goals.  A word is better than a
resolution. Not only is it shorter, but it's more robust. You make a
resolution in January, break it in February and now you're busted for
the year. You have let down your resolution.  What a failure! But a
watchword is an aspiration, a friendly reminder, there when you need it,
without ever failing.

In 2021, my watchword was

## Share

When I finished writing [Reflective Programs in Tree Calculus](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/tree-calculus/blob/master/tree_book.pdf)
 my publisher was unable to find an expert willing to write a
review, and didn't know what to do. So I pulled out and
self-published. But who would know it existed? So my word for the year was **share**. For
example, I summarised each chapter in a
[tweet](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/blog/blob/main/2024-12-23-tweets-on-trees.md).



In 2024, my watchword was

## Finish

Ever since the book went online, I
have been working on type systems for tree calculus, with the goal of typing a self-interpreter.
I accumulated
partial results by developing tree types, making them subtypes of
function types, and typing generic queries.  In mid 2023, I showed how to
type a self-interpreter, but only in the presence of a Top type, which
seemed like cheating.  I fully expected to eliminate it by the end of
that year but was still stuck. So my focus for 2024 was to **finish**
something. If necessary, write up the ugly solution with Top
types. Happily, this was avoided by introducing the *as-function*
types, which activate when their argument becomes a function type. The
same day as the verification in Coq was completed, I saw the call for
papers for [PEPM](https://popl25.sigplan.org/home/pepm-2025), wrote
the [paper](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/typed_tree_calculus/blob/main/typed_program_analysis.pdf)
in ten days for presentation in January. Finished!

This word helped keep me motivated through the year, but its true
value would have emerged if the better proof had not emerged. It would
have urged me to confront the issue, and made it easier to pursue the
weaker result.

Now it's time to choose a word for 2025. I still have a lifetime of
research goals (implementation of heaps as trees, generic algebraic
data types, complexity theory, foundations of mathematics, etc) but
need to pace myself a little. Working for three years without anything
to show for it was a little stressful. I kept reminding myself that
there is no Plan B. That done, I will keep working, but also need
to recharge the batteries. So my watchword for 2025 is

## Fun

What will your watchword be? 

### Comment James Eversole 

Hi Barry,

I wanted to thank you directly for sharing your discoveries related to the Tree Calculi. I came across your work as a result of Johannes Bader's website and have spent the last 3 weeks captivated by the possibilities of intensionality in practice. It led to me writing a small language in Haskell for exploring Tree Calculus very similar to the one Johannes implemented on his site's playground. While I'm not treading any new ground there, this has been an immensely fun and satisfying project that I can't seem to stop thinking about.

The sharing of your papers, Coq proofs, and blog posts are all deeply appreciated. I don't have a formal background in computer science or mathematics, so some of the insights in your blog posts were instrumental in me gaining an intuition for the Tree Calculus. Similarly helpful was being able to reference the Coq proofs when reading through Reflective Programs in Tree Calculus and Typed Program Analysis without Encodings. Again, thank you sincerely for making these resources easily and publicly available.

 I think your 2025 watchword "Fun" perfectly describes my feelings since discovering Tree Calculus a few weeks ago. It seems that my watchword will be "Learn" as I continue working towards a deeper understanding of both your research and the implications it has for practical programming.

Have a happy new year!

Thank you so much for the kind words. 
I'm particularly pleased that you have been able to get to grips with this, despite lacking any formal background, as I wrote the book with you as my ideal reader.

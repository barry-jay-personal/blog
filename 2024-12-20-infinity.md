# Taming Infinity
## Barry Jay
### 2024-12-20

The usual foundations of mathematics are beset with infinities,
despite the best efforts of the constructivists.  In set theory, for
example, the addition of natural numbers is an infinite set of ordered
pairs, while a real number is an infinite sequence.  One approach to
taming these infinities is to work with rules or processes instead of
sets. Then rule for addition can be described by a
$\lambda$-abstraction while a real number is a process for producing its
digits. However, the infinities re-appear in the
semantics of $\lambda$-calculus. For example, the meaning of a
$\lambda$-abstraction in domain theory is the limit of an infinite
sequence of approximations. Again, categorical semantics looks
promising but any grounding of it in domain theory or set theory
re-introduces the infinities.

Tree calculus seems to avoid these problems since functions and
processes are represented by natural binary trees, which are finite.
Of course, processes may not terminate, so computation may go on
forever, but at each moment the computation is a finite tree, which is
all that we can ask for. Programs are finite, even if computation time
is unbounded.

My book [Reflective Programs in Tree
Calculus](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/tree-calculus/tree_book.pdf)
shows how to implement arithmetic but does not go on to consider real numbers, etc.
so here is very first attempt, hot off the whiteboard. (Yes! I have a whiteoard at home, hanging on the door of my study. Usually the door is open, with the board facing my desk, but if the door is closed, then the board serves as fair warning.) 

Every program $r$ can be viewed as a real number between zero and one, expressed in binary digits, as follows.
 - If the application of $r$ to zero is not a boolean then the real number is zero.
 - If the application of $r$ to zero is a boolean then that is the first digit, with the rest produced by applying $r$ to one, etc.
 - If the application of $r$ to zero does not have a value then neither does $r$.

Thus, if applications of $r$ take boolean values on arguments from
zero to some $n$ but does not have a value on the successor of $n$
then $r$ is partially-defined, with only its first $n+1$ digits known.
It should be possible to develop the usual arithmetic operations on
the reals. I can also imagine defining the algebraic numbers as
solutions to equations. Even transcendental numbers such as $\pi$ and
$e$ should be doable, as their digits are defined by rules. What else? Let us know if you try this out!

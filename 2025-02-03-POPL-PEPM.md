# PEPM and POPL 2025

I had a great time at [PEPM](https://popl25.sigplan.org/home/pepm-2025) and [POPL](https://conf.researchr.org/home/POPL-2025) in Denver! My plan was to write
about it on getting home, but missed my connection at LAX (apparently,
when lightning hits a plane its a big deal) so spent 20 hours in the
terminal waiting for the next one, and am only now recovering.

My [talk](https://www.youtube.com/live/agt3VwTYLpM?si=JEv8xEg_5Fzou6v0&t=21932) at PEPM was well received. No-one objected "But that contradicts the Church-Turing Thesis!" 
Instead, everyone was listening, trying to
integrate this new worldview. What more could I
ask for?


In the hallway track, I was a demon, waiting to be
summonsed. I would chat, ask about their work, but whenever someone said " And what are you working on?" I
would show them the frontispiece of my [book](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/tree-calculus/blob/master/tree_book.pdf), that displays the
self-evaluator, and then they were hooked, most going straight to our
splash page. My favourite reaction was "Each of those dots must be an
abstraction, right; what are they?"  "No," I proudly replied "they're
just the nodes of a tree; there are only 509 of them".  It was very
satisfying.

At a deeper level, I enjoyed technical discussions about combinators,
logic and compiler construction.  Someone asked me about a paper I
wrote twenty years ago! I had to look it up online, reminding me of
the old professor who spluttered at the young me "I've forgotten more
than you'll ever know!"

Three discussions suggested possible future directions for tree
calculus.  First, I got to shake hands with Johannes Bader for the
first time, after Zooming for over a year. We wondered "What can we do
face-to-face that we can't do online?" "I don't know" I said  "but at
least I can see your profile!" I had been thinking about how to
internalise the type system, so that typed terms of tree calculus are
embedded in the untyped calculus. He suggested that we look at gradual
typing, where type inference and checking that cannot be handled
statically is delayed until runtime.

Second, Vikraman Choudury gave an interesting [talk](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3704848) on
co-lambda-abstractions, which, like lambda-mu-calculus, provide
support for classical logic and control operators. When I asked if he had a
combinatorial account of the co-lambdas, he replied "Not yet, but I want one." It seems that many of the side conditions on
the reduction rules can be expressed using *intensional
combinators*. For example, that some expressions are values can be
captured by an operator V that is not expressble as a combination of
S, K and I. The downside is that this willl not fit into his larger
framework, using category theory.

Third, were some new ideas triggered by discussion with Johannes.  Since
programs now have normal forms, all of the parametric polymorphism of
System F can be captured by tree types. That is, for trivial reasons,
all program have principal types! The challenge,
then is to decide when programs have function types, so that type
inference amounts to the following problem. Given a program of type $T$
and an argument of type $U$, find the smallest type $V$ (if any) such that
$T< U\longrightarrow V$. Perhaps type inference for System F can work
after all!
